# CovidTracker 

This is the database portion of a PHP web app to track covid statistics. The PHP code is hidden as it would be an honor violation in both the sense that my university prohibits it and it would make it seem like I know PHP!

My role in this project was entirely on the data side. I cleaned hundreds of thousands of rows often with corrupt or incomplete data. I designed the database schema and made the E-R diagram. I designed the complex queries the app needs to function.
